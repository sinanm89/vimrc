vimrc
=====
My personal vimrc for general text editing.

supports python markdown and some other stuff.

first do:

    git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

then install plugins:

Launch vim and run 

    :PluginInstall

To install from command line: 

    vim +PluginInstall +qall
